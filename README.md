# Snake-Game-

This snake game, written in Python, challenges players to guide a snake to eat as many food items as possible without running into the walls or its own tail. The snake's length increases with each food item consumed, making the game increasingly difficult.  Overall, this snake game is a fun and challenging way to test your reflexes and strategic thinking.
